        <p>
            jpgs (short version of Java Postgres Server) is a java implementation of
            the server side of the
            <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/protocol.html">Postgres Frontend/Backend Protocol</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that with this library it is possible to create a server that
            is binary compatible with Postgres 9.4.
            Written mostly for research purposes, this project can be used to mock
            a Postgres database for test purposes or to provide a standard and well known
            interface to a new data container.

            There are three big entry points to use this project:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>{@link edu.purdue.jpgs.BaseConnection}</dt>
            <dd>contains the low level implementation of the protocol;</dd>
            <dt>{@link edu.purdue.jpgs.SimpleConnection}</dt>
            <dd>implements a simplified version of the protocol, abstracting by
                many details and exposing a simpler interface to return results.
            </dd>
            <dt>{@link edu.purdue.jpgs.ConnectionPool}</dt>
            <dd>implements a container that spawn new threads on incoming connections
                and handles running instances of the BaseConnection</dd>
        </dl>
